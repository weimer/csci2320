<h1>Overview</h1>

<p> 
<b>Principles of Programming Languages</b> (CSCI 2320) will acquaint
you with the fundamental ideas surrounding the design and implementation of
high-level programming languages. The course will stress underlying theoretical
concepts as well as a significant, practical course project. At the same
time, the course will focus on making this material accessible to students
of varied backgrounds. 
</p>
<p>
Students will gain experience with functional and object-oriented programming
via the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_Caml">
OCaml</a> and
<a href="cool.html">Cool</a> programming languages. In addition, students
may complete assignments using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29">
Python</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_programming_language">
Ruby</a>, 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">
JavaScript</a>, or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29">
Haskell</a> languages.
The Assignments and final project in this course lead to the
construction of an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29">interpreter</a>
for a subset of Java. This involves scanning, parsing,
type-checking and interpreting code. You will master concepts such as
context-free grammars, variable bindings, control flow, types, subtyping,
and method invocation. 
</p>

<h1>Project and Assignments</h1> 
<p>
The course project consists of 
five Programming
Assignments. Taken together,
the assignments form a complete interpreter for <a href="cool.html">Cool,
the <i>Classroom Object-Oriented Language</i></a>. 
The project components are assigned in roughly increasing order of size and
difficulty; proportionately more time is allotted for the later
assignments.  Later assignments will be weighted more heavily in the final
grade. 
</p>
<p> 
Programs will be evaluated for correctness,
organization, and documentation.
</p> 
<p> 
Assignments may be done individually or in teams of two. The
first assignment must be done
individually, however. Teamwork imposes burdens of communication and
coordination, but has the benefits of more thoughtful designs and cleaner
programs. Team programming is also the norm in the professional world.
</p>
<p>
Students on a team are expected to participate equally in the effort and to
be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the joint work. Both members
bear full responsibility for the completion of assignments. Partners turn
in one solution for each Assignment; each member receives the
same grade for the assignment. If a partnership is not going well, speak
with the instructor. 
</p> 
<p> 
Assignments are due at <b>11:50pm</b> on the date in the course
schedule. Programming Assignments will be turned in electronically via a
special submission server.
</p> 

<h1>Course Programming Languages</h1> 

<p>
Three programming languages are required as part of this course: 
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="cool.html">Cool</a> is an imperative, strongly-typed
classroom object-oriented programming language. It can be viewed as a
simplified version of Java. You will learn Cool as part of this course.

<li> 
<a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> is an efficient, functional,
strongly-typed, object-oriented language with imperative support. You will
learn OCaml as part of this course. 

<li>
<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
is a structured, imperative programming language with
a high emphasis on readability and support for object-oriented and
functional programming. You are expected to know imperative and
object-oriented prorgamming in Python before entering this course; you will
learn functional programming in Python as part of this course.

</ul> 

<p>
In addition, three additional optional languages are available and
you may use them to complete programming assignments.
</p> 

<ul>

<li> 
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> 
is an advanced, statically-typed, lazy, purely functional language. 

<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
is a dynamically-typed language with object-oriented, imperative
and functional support; it is often used in web and asynchronous
programming. 

<li> 
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>
is an imperative, dynamically typed, object-oriented
language with functional support. 

</ul> 

<h1>Review Sets</h1>

<p>
There are <a href="exams.html">seven Review Sets</a> 
provided for this course.
These Review Sets are not graded assignments, and
are instead provided as a structured system for students to evaluate
their mastery of the material and prepare for written examinations. The
instructor will be happy to go over Review Set
answers during office hours.
</p>

<h1>Examinations</h1>

<p>
This course features <a href="exams.html">two midterm
examinations</a> and may contain a final examination. The midterms will be
take home. 
</P>
<p>
The exams are open-note by default.
It may not be possible to give late or make-up exams:
please plan accordingly. 
</p>

<h1>Grading</h1>

<p>
The relative weight of the
components of your grade will be approximately:
</p> 

<div class="container">
      <div class="row row-centered">
        <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-centered col-min">

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <span class="badge">5%</span> Programming Assignment I
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <span class="badge">8%</span> Programming Assignment II
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">

    <span class="badge">15%</span> Programming Assignment V
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">

    <span class="badge">15%</span> Final Examination
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">
    <span class="badge">5%</span> Reading Quizzes &amp; Participation
  </li>
</ul>
</div></div> </div> 

<p>
The course may be curved &mdash; but it will only be curved upward. We
never reduce your grade. 
</p> 
<p> 
We follow <a
href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/dean-of-students/ccs/community-standards/the-codes.html">the Bowdoin Academic Honor Code</a>.
You should know that fairly sophisticated plagiarism detection software
may be used on the Assignments; cheating on an assignment or exam
typically results in a score of 0 for it as well as a score of 0 for the
entire course. 
</p> 

<h1>Regrade and Late Policy</h1>

<p>
An assignment turned in <i>h</i> hours late has its point value reduced by
<i>h</i>%. Thus if you turn in a Assignment at 8am the next day
(i.e., 8 hours late) your grade for that assignment will be multiplied by
0.92. 
</p> 
<p>
Each student has <b>three late-day tokens</b> for programming submissions. 
Each token allows you to submit an assignment 24 hours after its hard
deadline. These are "no questions asked" grace days &mdash; you do not have
to explain to me what the reason is or talk about any issues unless you
want to. 
</p> 
<p> 
Regrades for exams, Assignments, or written assignments must be
received within <b>one week</b> of you receiving your score. All regrade
requests should be made to the instructor. When we regrade an assignment we will
look over it very carefully for correctness: it is possible that after a
regrade you will end up with <i>fewer</i> points than before the regrade.
</p> 
<p>
All course materials submitted for a grade must be turned in by the last
date marked on the course syllabus.
</p> 

<h1>Research</h1>

<p>
Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. (If you're curious about how anonymized student data has
led to research advances in the past, ask on the forum!) 
Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor to do so after final grades have been issued. This has no
impact on your grade in any manner. 
</p> 
<p>
Students interested in considering undergraduate research should make an
appointment to talk about it. While I am not in a position to supervise
Bowdoin students directly, I can talk about approaching other professors and
help assess potential research or thesis ideas. I am also happy to discuss
graduate school.
