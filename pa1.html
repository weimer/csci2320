<h1>PA1 &mdash; The Rosetta Stone</h1> 

<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> 
aided linguistic understanding by providing the same text in three
different languages. In this project you will implement the same simple
program in <i>two</i> separate languages: OCaml and Cool.
Both of your implementations will have exactly the same interface, will
otherwise adhere to the same specification, and should behave exactly the
same way.  
<p>
In PA2 through PA5 you will write an interpreter for Cool, so it is
important that you learn how Cool works now. 
</p>
<p>
To practice or test your skills, you may also submit 
C,
Haskell, 
JavaScript, 
Python,
or Ruby implementations. These will be tested, and can earn you extra
credit, but are not
necessary for your grade.
</p> 
<p>
For this assignment, you must work <b>alone</b>. Subsequent assignments
will allow you to work in pairs. 
</p> 

<h1>Specification</h1> 

<p>
Your program must take in a list of dependent tasks and either output
a valid order in which to perform them or the single word <tt>cycle</tt>.  
</p> 
<p> 
Your program will accept a number of lines of textual input (via <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard input</a>). 
There are <b>no</b> command-line arguments &mdash; you must always read
from standard input. Do not open a named file. Instead, always read from
standard input. 
</p> 
<p> 
That text input will contain a non-zero but even
number of lines. Every two lines represent a <i>pair</i> of tasks. The
first line gives the name of a task, the second line gives the name of a
task that it depends on. This text input is also called the <i>task list</i>. 
</p> 
<p> 
The task list will contain only standard ASCII characters (no UTF/8 Unicode
or special accents). The goal is to test programming and program language
concepts, not your internationalization abilities. 
</p> 
<p> 
Each task name starts at the beginning of the line and extends all the way
up to (but not including) the end of that line. So the newline or carriage
return characters <tt>\r</tt> or <tt>\n</tt> are not part of the task name. 
Each task name is at most 60 characters long. (This limit is to make any C
implementation easier. Cool and OCaml both support longer strings
natively, and can thus ignore this length limit.) 
</p> 
<p> 
Example task list: 
</p> 
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-body">
learn C<br>
read the C tutorial<br>
do PA1<br>
learn C
  </div>
</div> 
<p>
The interpretation is that in order to <b>learn C</b> one must first
<b>read the C tutorial</b> and that in order to <b>do PA1</b> one must
first <b>learn C</b>. Desired output for this example: 
</p> 
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-body">
read the C tutorial<br>
learn C<br>
do PA1
</div></div> 
<p>
If the task list containts a <i>cycle</i> of any size, your program should
output exactly and only the word <b>cycle</b>. Example cyclic input: 
</p> 
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-body">
get a job<br>
have experience<br>
have experience<br>
work on a job<br>
work on a job<br>
get a job
</div></div> 
<p>
Even if the task list contains a few non-cyclic parts, any single cycle
forces you to output only the word <tt>cycle</tt>. 
</p> 
<p>
Always output to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard output</a>
only. Do not write anything to stderr. 
</p> 
<p>
There is no fixed limit on the number of lines in the task list (although
it is not zero and it is even). 
</p>
<p>
Two tasks with the same name are really just the same task. Use standard
string equality. 
</p>
<p>
Duplicated pairs of tasks are not allowed. For example: 
</p>
<div class="panel panel-primary">
  <div class="panel-body">
learn C<br>
read the C tutorial<br>
do PA1<br>
learn C<br>
learn C<br>
read the C tutorial
</div></div>
</pre> </ul>
<p>
... that task list is <i>not</i> valid input because the pair <b>learn
C</b>/<b>read the C tutorial</b> appears twice. Program behavior if the
task list contains a duplicate pair is undefined. You will not be tested on
it. 
</p> 
<p>
Your program may <i>not</i> cause any other file I/O to be performed, such
as creating a temporary file to keep track of some intermediate sorting
results or writing to stderr (or even causing the interpreter to write a
warning to stderr). You do not need any such temporary files or
stderr-printing to solve this problem.  
</p> 

<h2>Specification &mdash; Choosing Among Unconstrained Tasks</h2> 

<p>
If there are multiple outstanding unconstrained tasks, your program should
output them in ascending ASCII alphabetical order.  That is, if you ever
have two or more tasks, each of which has no remaining dependencies, output
the one that comes first ASCII-alphabetically. (This constraint makes your
program deterministic; for any given input there is only one correct
output.) Example: 
</p> 
<div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-body">
learn C <br>
understand C pointers <br>
learn C <br>
read the C tutorial <br>
do PA1 <br>
learn C
</div></div> 
<p>
Because <b>r</b> comes before <b>u</b>, your output should be: 
</p>
<div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-body">
read the C tutorial <br>
understand C pointers  <br>
learn C <br>
do PA1
</div></div> 
<p> 
To put it another way, consider this task list: 
</p> 
<div class="panel panel-primary"> <div class="panel-body">
B <br>
A <br>
C <br>
D <br>
C <br>
E
</div></div> 
<p>
Which yields a dependency graph like this: 
</p> 
<prE>
A  D E
|  \ /
B   C
</prE> 
<p>
The proper ordering for this set of tasks is <b>A B D E C</b>. Note that
<b>B</b> comes before <b>D</b> and <b>E</b>, even though <b>B</b>
depends on <b>A</b>. This is because, once <b>A</b> is finished,
<b>B</b> is free to go and it comes first alphabetically. You may want to
consider this requirement when you pick your sorting algorithm. Given this
requirement the answer <b>A D E B C</b> is <i>incorrect</i> and will
receive no credit. 
</p> 

<h1>Resources</h1> 

For this programming assignment, two coding resources are available: 
<ul>
  <li> <a href="pa1-hint.zip">pa1-hint.zip</a> &mdash; provides concrete
  implementations of "task list reversal" (a similar, but simpler, problem)
  in every language associated with this course
  <li> <a href="pa1-testcases.zip">pa1-testcases.zip</a> &mdash; includes a
  number of test inputs and expected outputs so that you can test your
  programs before submitting
  <li> <a href="pa1-testcases-osx.zip">pa1-testcases-osx.zip</a> &mdash;
  as above, but with <b>unix</b> linefeed formatting in all text files
  for use in Mac OS X
</ul> 

<h1>Commentary</h1> 

<p>
This problem is just <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort">topological sort</a>
not-so-cleverly disguised. Feel free to look up how to do toposort on the
internet (but remember that you must turn in your own work; you may not
copy someone else's code and claim it as your own). 
</p><p>
Take a look at the files in <tt>pa1-hint.zip</tt>. You could do worse than
using them as starting points. 
</p><p>
If you're having trouble writing anything reasonable in Cool, don't forget
to look at the <a href="cool.html">other example Cool programs</a>.
</p><p>
Building and maintaining an explicit graph structure is probably overkill.
</p><p>
You could solve the problem in the Python, Ruby or OCaml first
(depending on where you are most comfortable) and then just translate
your solution. Translating into Cool, Haskell, JavaScript
or C will not be as easy, however.  
</p><p>
Use this as an opportunity to see what you like about various languages.
What do you think of Python's enforced tabbing? How about ML's abysmal
error reporting? Ruby's below-par execution speed? Haskell's IO Monad? 
JavaScript's more asynchronous I/O model? C's general hideousness? 
</p><p>
For bonus brownie points, try to make any OCaml, Haskell, JavaScript, Ruby
or Python implementation as functional as possible (e.g., eschew side
effects). 
</p>

<h1>Video Guides</h1> 

<p>
A number of Video Guides are provided to help you get started on this
assignment on your own. The Video Guides are walkthroughs in which the
instructor manually completes and narrates, in real time, a similar
assignment. They include coding, testing and debugging elements.
</p> 
<p>
If you are still stuck, you can post on the forum,
approach the TAs, or approach the professor. The use of online
instructional content outside of class weakly approximates a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">flipped classroom
model</a>. Click on a video guide to begin, at which point you can watch
it fullscreen or via Youtube if desired.

<h1>Hints</h1> 
<p>
Because you receive extra credit for a working Python (or Ruby, if you
prefer) implementation (see the Grading Rubric below), we recommend that
you complete the task in Python first. That way you can be sure that you
understand the toposort <i>algorithm</i> in a familiar language before you
try it in an unfamiliar one. Once you have it working in Python, you
translate that into Cool or OCaml (see the Video Guides for an example of
doing the same problem in Python and then OCaml). The automated grading
server will grade any Python implementation you submit, giving you useful
feedback on algorithmic correctness. This "Python-first" approach ends up
being mathematically optimal for most students. 
</p> 

<h1>What To Turn In For PA1c</h1> 

<p>
PA1c is a <b>checkpoint</b> to make sure that you do not fall behind on
PA1. You have about two weeks to complete all of PA1, but if you try to
do it all at the last minute you're probably doomed to failure.  
</p> <p> 
For the one-week PA1c checkpoint, you must have <i>one</i> of the
implementations done. This separates the project into two phases: (0) Can I
write this program at all? and (1) Can I write this program in multiple
languages? 
</p> <p> 
For PA1c you must turn in <b>one source
file</b>. Use the
following names: 
<ol>
  <li> <tt>rosetta.cl</tt> &mdash; Cool implementation
  <br> <i>or</i> 
  <li> <tt>rosetta.ml</tt> &mdash; OCaml implementation
</ol> 
<p>
You may also submit Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Haskell or C implementations
for PA1 extra credit.  Each of your source files should have one of those names
(e.g., <tt>rosetta.<i>whatever</i></tt>). 
</p> 

<h1>What To Turn In For PA1</h1> 

<p>
For PA1c you must turn in two source
files and two other files. Use the following names: 
</p> 
<ol>
  <li> <tt>rosetta.cl</tt> &mdash; Cool implementation
  <li> <tt>rosetta.ml</tt> &mdash; OCaml implementation
</ol> 
<p>
You may also submit Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Haskell or C implementations
for PA1 extra credit.  
You must also submit these two files: 
</p> 
<ol start="3">
  <li> <tt>testcase.list</tt> &mdash; a valid task list that you made up
  <li> <tt>readme.txt</tt> &mdash; your README file 
</ol> 
<p>
The <tt>testcase.list</tt> file should contain a valid novel task list (it
may or may not contain a cycle &mdash; your choice). 
</p> <p>
The <tt>readme.txt</tt> file should be a <i>plain ASCII text file</i> (not a
Word file, not an RTF file, not an HTML file) describing your design
decisions. Which language did you start with? How did you store the
(implicit) graph? Which language was the hardest? One or two English
paragraphs should suffice. Spelling, grammar, capitalization and
punctuation all count. 
</p> 

<h1>Extra Credit</h1> 

<p>
The submission grading server will accept and report on any of the
following languages, if you happen to submit them:
</p> 

<ol>
  <li> <tt>rosetta.c</tt> &mdash; C implementation
  <li> <tt>rosetta.cl</tt> &mdash; Cool implementation
  <li> <tt>rosetta.hs</tt> &mdash; Haskell implementation
  <li> <tt>rosetta.js</tt> &mdash; JavaScript implementation
  <li> <tt>rosetta.ml</tt> &mdash; OCaml implementation
  <li> <tt>rosetta.py</tt> &mdash; Python implementation
  <br> <i>and/or</i> 
  <li> <tt>rosetta.rb</tt> &mdash; Ruby implementation
</ol> 

<p>
Note that only the Cool and OCaml implementations are required for your
grade. The others cannot hurt you in any way, but can provide extra credit
if you complete them perfectly.
</p>

<h1>Grading Rubric</h1>

<p>
PA1 Grading (out of 25 points):
</p> 
    <ul>
    <li> 20 points &mdash; autograding
      <ul>
      <li> 10 points &mdash; autograder tests for PA1c (either OCaml or
      Cool)
      <li> 10 points &mdash; autograder tests for PA1 (either OCaml or
      Cool, the other one)
      <li> The scoring is proportional: if there are 8 tests for PA1c and
      your best submission passes 4 of them (50%), you will receive 5/10
      points for PA1c (50%). 
      </ul> 
    </li> 
    <li> 4 points &mdash; for a clear description in your README
      <ul> 
      <li> 4 &mdash; thorough discussion of design decisions (including language
      comparisons) and choice of test cases; a few paragraphs
      of coherent English sentences should be fine
      <li> 2 &mdash; vague or hard to understand; omits important details
      <li> 0 &mdash; little to no effort, or submitted an RTF/DOC/PDF file
      instead of plain TXT
      </ul>
    </li> 
    <li> 1 point &mdash; for a valid <tt>testcase.list</tt> file
    <p>
    <li> 5 points <i>extra credit</i> &mdash; for extra languages
      <ul>
        <li> 1 point <i>extra credit</i> &mdash; perfect autograder test
        results for C 
        <li> 1 point <i>extra credit</i> &mdash; perfect autograder test
        results for Haskell 
        <li> 1 point <i>extra credit</i> &mdash; perfect autograder test
        results for JavaScript 
        <li> 1 point <i>extra credit</i> &mdash; perfect autograder test
        results for Python 
        <li> 1 point <i>extra credit</i> &mdash; perfect autograder test
