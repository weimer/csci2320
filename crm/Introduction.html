<p>
This manual describes the programming language Cool: the \(\it C\)lassroom \(\it O\)bject-\(\it O\)riented \(\it L\)anguage. Cool is a small language that can be implemented with reasonable effort in a one semester course. Still, Cool retains many of the features of modern programming languages including objects, static typing, and automatic memory management.
</p>

<p>
Cool programs are sets of \(\it classes\). A class encapsulates the variables and procedures of a data type. Instances of a class are \(\it objects\). In Cool, classes and types are identified. That is, every class defines a type. Classes permit programmers to define new types and associated procedures (or \(\it methods\)) specific to those types. Inheritance allows new types to extend the behavior of existing types.
</p>

<p>
Cool is an \(\it expression\) language. Most Cool constructs are expressions, and every expression has a value and a type. Cool is \(\it type\ safe\): procedures are guaranteed to be applied to data of the correct type. While static typing imposes a strong discipline on programming in Cool, it guarantees that no runtime type errors can arise in the execution of Cool programs.
</p>

<p>
This manual is divided into informal and formal components. For a short, informal overview, the first half (through Section <a href="Main Class.html">9</a>) suffices. The formal description begins with Section <a href="Lexical Structure.html">10</a>.
