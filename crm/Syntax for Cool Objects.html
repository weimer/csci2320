<p>
Every Cool value is an object. Objects contain a list of named attributes, a bit like records in C. In addition, each object belongs to a class. We use the following syntax for values in Cool:
</p>

\[
v = X(a_{1} = l_{1}, a_{2} = l_{2}, \dots , a_{n} = l_{n})
\]

<p>
Read the syntax as follows: The value \( v\) is a member of class \(X\) containing the attributes \(a_1, \ldots, a_n\) whose locations are  \(l_1, \ldots, l_n\). Note that the attributes have an associated location. Intuitively this means that there is some space in memory reserved for each attribute. The value \( v\) has dynamic type \(X\).
</p>

<p>
For base objects of Cool (i.e., \(\tt Int\)s, \(\tt String\)s, and \(\tt Bool\)s) we use a special case of the above syntax. Base objects have a class name, but their attributes are not like attributes of normal classes, because they cannot be modified. Therefore, we describe base objects using the following syntax:
</p>

\[
\begin{array}{l}
Int(5)
\\
Bool(true)
\\
String(4,{\tt"Cool"})
\end{array}
\]

<p>
For \(\tt Int\)s and \(\tt Bool\)s, the meaning is obvious. \(\tt String\)s contain two parts, the length and the actual sequence of ASCII characters.
