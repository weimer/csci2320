<p>
\(\bf Binary\ Arithmetic\)
</p>

<p>
Cool has four binary arithmetic operations: \(\rm +,\ -,\ *,\ /\). The syntax is
</p>
<pre>
expr1 &lt;op&gt; expr2
</pre>
<p>
To evaluate such an expression first \(\rm expr1\) is evaluated and then \(\rm expr2\). The result of the operation is the result of the expression.
</p>

<p>
The static types of the two sub-expressions must be \(\rm Int\). The static type of the entire arithmetic expression is also \(\rm Int\). Cool has only integer division.
</p>

<p>
\(\bf Binary\ Relations\)
</p>

<p>
Cool has three comparison operations: \(\rm &lt;,\ &lt;=,\ =\). These comparisons may be applied to subexpressions of any types, subject to the following rules:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
\(\rm expr1\) is an \(\rm Int\) if and only if \(\rm expr2\) is an \(\rm Int\)

<li>
\(\rm expr1\) is a \(\rm String\) if and only if \(\rm expr2\) is a \(\rm String\)

<li>
\(\rm expr1\) is a \(\rm Bool\) if and only if \(\rm expr2\) is a \(\rm Bool\)

<li>
Otherwise, \(\rm expr1\) may be of any type (including \(\rm SELF\_TYPE\)) and \(\rm expr2\) may be of any (possibly different) type (including \(\rm SELF\_TYPE\)).

</ul>

<p>
In all cases, the result of the comparison is a \(\rm Bool\). See <a href="Type Checking Rules.html">the type checking rules</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
In principle, there is nothing wrong with permitting equality tests between, for example, \(\rm Bool\) and \(\rm Int\). However, such a test must always be false and almost certainly indicates some sort of programming error. The Cool type checking rules catch such errors at compile-time instead of waiting until runtime.
</p>

<p>
On non-basic objects, equality is decided via pointer equality (i.e., whether the memory addresses of the objects are the same). Equality is defined for \(\rm void\): two \(\rm void\) values are equal and a \(\rm void\) value is never equal to a non-\(\rm void\) value. See <a href="Operational Rules.html">the operational semantics rules</a> for more informaiton.
</p>

<p>
\(\bf Unary\ Expressions\)
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is one unary arithmetic and one unary logical operator.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The expression \(\rm \sim\ &lt;expr&gt;\) is the integer complement of \(\rm &lt;expr&gt;\). The subexpression \(\rm &lt;expr&gt;\) must have static type \(\rm Int\) and the entire expression has static type \(\rm Int\).

<li>
The expression \(\rm not &lt;expr&gt;\) is the boolean complement of \(\rm &lt;expr&gt;\). The subexpression \(\rm &lt;expr&gt;\) must have static type \(\rm Bool\) and the entire expression has static type \(\rm Bool\).

</ul>
